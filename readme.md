# Warehouse Management System

This is a Warehouse Management System (WMS) implemented in Python. It provides functionality for managing inventory, suppliers, categories, transactions, and user actions within a warehouse.

Based on the requirements in /Documentation/Assignment_Week_7_8_level_2.pdf.

It's missing diagrams due to the fact that I ended up becoming sick this sunday, the 24th of march and some menus have still not been implemented due to the same fact.

## Diagrams
To be made and descriped here.

## Features
